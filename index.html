            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>The App provides ideas and inspiration through the community atmosphere within the App. Users are able to share their fitness progress and personal recipes encouraging participation, commitment, self discipline, and creativity around the monotonous task of dieting and weight-loss. By providing detailed recipes according to a user’s information, preferences and constraints, they are provided with a multitude of options that will satisfy their nutritional needs and help them further with their weight goals.</p>
            <h4>My Role</h4>
            <p>As one of three designers, we all took a hands on approach to the research process and design layout. Based off of our interviews, we focused on the user’s goals and paint points. Taking those insights into consideration, we created a user persona that became a reference of how we wanted our prototpye to look and work. After drawing up some wireframes, my group and I came together to combine our ideas into one cohesive wireframe. Once built, I added clickable features onto my section of the prototype to make it interactive.</p>
